## Mekorama Tools

This project was initiated out of my curiosity about unreleased Mekorama blocks.
Its primary function is to facilitate block replacement.

DISCLAIMER:
Some block names and attributes (such as orientation and texture font) are not taken from the original game, but rather are named after some research into the blocks.
	
WARNING:
Be careful, as unreleased blocks can exhibit uncontrollable behavior.
Some blocks require certain conditions to be met,
for example, the 'wheel' must be attached to a movable block. Otherwise, the application will crash.
